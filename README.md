I have analyzed global EV charging data to understand: Charging cost variations  Charger utilization , Temperature impacts on session reliability
## Dataset
**Global EV Charging Behavior Dataset (2024)**  
Includes:
['country', 'city', 'charging_station_id',  'charging_station_type', 'ev_model', 'manufacturer', 'battery_capacity_(kwh)', 'charging_start_time', 'charging_end_time', 'charging_duration_(mins)', 'energy_delivered_(kwh)', 'charging_cost_($)', 'payment_method', 'temperature_(°c)', 'charging_session_outcome', 'station_utilization_rate_(%)']
## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
##  Key Findings
- Charging costs vary significantly across countries due to differences in energy pricing and infrastructure maturity.
- DC fast chargers deliver higher energy per session compared to AC chargers.
- Charging session failures increase at temperature extremes, highlighting the need for climate-resilient charging infrastructure.
- Certain EV manufacturers show consistently shorter charging durations, likely due to higher charging power compatibility.
##  Relevance & Applications
- EV infrastructure planning
- Energy optimization
- Policy and regulatory analysis
- Climate-resilient transport systems
